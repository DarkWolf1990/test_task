    Calculate the area of a shape.

    This function demonstrates runtime polymorphism â€” it can calculate
    the area without knowing the specific shape type at compile time.

    Args:
        shape (Shape): Object that inherits from Shape class (Circle, Triangle, etc.)

    Returns:
        float: Area of the shape

    Raises:
        TypeError: If shape is not an instance of Shape

    Example:
        >>> from square_round import Circle, calculate_area
        >>> circle = Circle(5)
        >>> area = calculate_area(circle)
        >>> print(f"Area: {area:.2f}")
